## Depositor bot description
Depositor bot - Deposits buffered ether via depositBufferedEther call on "DepositSecurityModule" smart contract using special gas strategy.

The strategy is to check two things: how much buffered ether on smart contract are and gas fee.

We deposit when all the following points are correct:
- We received council signatures enough for quorum.
- Gas fee is lower or equal than 5-th percentile for past day.
- There are buffered ether more or equal than calculation from special formula that depend on gas fee.

## Pauser bot
If one of the councils send pause message (means something very bad going on), depositor bot try to send tx that will pause protocol.  
Also, council daemon also tries to pause protocol by itself


## How to install

Only for development: [Ganache CLI](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) is required to run [Brownie](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie)

```bash 
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

Python packages
```bash
git clone git@github.com:lidofinance/depositor-bot.git
cd depositor-bot
poetry install
```

## Run script

To run (development):  

Envs:
```bash
export WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=...
export KAFKA_BROKER_ADDRESS_1=...
export KAFKA_USERNAME=...
export KAFKA_PASSWORD=...
export KAFKA_TOPIC=...
```

Run:  
```bash
# For depositor bot
brownie run depositor --network=mainnet

# For pause bot
brownie run pause --network=mainnet
```

##  Deploy

To run bot in dry mode in docker:
1. Required envs:`NETWORK` (e.g. mainnet) and `WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID`.
2. Run
```bash
docker-compose up
```
*Optional*: provide `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` env to run with account.  
*Optional*: provide `CREATE_TRANSACTIONS` env ('true') to send tx to mempool.

## Release flow

To create new release:

1. Merge all changes to the `main` branch
1. Navigate to Repo => Actions
1. Run action "Prepare release" action against `main` branch
1. When action execution is finished, navigate to Repo => Pull requests
1. Find pull request named "chore(release): X.X.X" review and merge it with "Rebase and merge" (or "Squash and merge")
1. After merge release action will be triggered automatically
1. Navigate to Repo => Actions and see last actions logs for further details
